# Introduction to the BlockForge Universe
The Blockforge will be designed to support multiple worlds that users can explore and occupy. Each World will run on its own server and will be connected to one another through sharding. Each world will have its own unique characters and will have territories for users to purchase with $FORGE.

## Island of Karniel

The Island of Karniel will be the first world that is available for users to Explore. The world is 10,000x10,000 large with 10,000 territories available for purchase. Each Territory will be a dimension 100x100 blocks that are available for purchase. Within the Island of Karniel, the user can find the BlockForge Castle at [-500 150 -500].
